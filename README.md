Swarm Simulator
===============
**A simulation of a multi-agent swarm performing the retrieval of resources.**

Ok, here is the initial package for our group project, Evolutionary Programming of Particle Swarm Movement. There are several things that need to be built:

1. A headless simulator that runs with speed for fitness evaluation
2. An evolutionary programming/genetic programming construct to evolve the swarm
3. A visual simulator so that we can see what the swarm is doing at any given timestep.

Note that I had started this project with just the visual component in mind, so if we have to reorganize or rename any of the code, that is perfectly fine with me.
