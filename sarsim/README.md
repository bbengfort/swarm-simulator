# SAR Simulation #
**Offline or non-visual Search and Retrieval Simulator**

[![Astroid Mining][astroid_mining.jpg]][astroid_mining.jpg]

This package is designed to implement an offline (non-visual) search and retrieval simulation based on the implementation in [1]. This offline simulation will then be used to evaluate the fitness of various parameters that are loaded via YAML configuration file.
